                    <h1>The Upper Lake</h1>
                    <p>Bhojtal, formerly known as Upper Lake,[1] is a large lake which lies on the western side of the
                        capital city of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, India. It is a major source of drinking water for the
                        residents of the city, serving around 40% of the residents with nearly 30 million imperial
                        gallons (140,000 m3) of water per day.[2] Bada talaab, along with the nearby Chhota Talaab,
                        meaning small lake in Hindi, constitute Bhoj Wetland, which is now a Ramsar site.[3]Bhojtal is
                        situated on the west central part of Bhopal city and is surrounded by Van Vihar National Park on
                        the south, human settlements on the east and north, and agriculture fields on the west.[3] It
                        has an area of 31 km2, and drains a catchment or watershed of 361 km2. The watershed of the
                        Upper Lake is mostly rural, with some urbanized areas around its eastern end. The Kolans was
                        formerly a tributary of the Halali River, but with the creation of the lake using an earthen dam
                        and a diversion channel, the upper reach of the Kolans River and Bada Talaab now drain into the
                        Kaliasote River.

                        <p>The Moti Masjid was built by Sikander Jehan Begum, the daughter of Qadsia Begum in the year 1860. Saikander Jahanâ€™s era is considered as the golden era in Bhopalâ€™s history. She was a powerful ruler trained in Martial art and fought many a battle during her tenure. She succeeded her mother in the year of 1844 to become the ruler of Bhopal. Unlike other women of her time, she was driven by modern ideologies and practices. She was against the purdah system and thus never used veil in her entire life. She abolished slavery and was in favor of providing equal rights to everyone. It is only during her tenure, that women in Bhopal for the first time got a taste of liberty and modern beliefs. The Begums of 19th century constructed many glorious monuments and Moti Masjid is one of them.
